Text Summarization
Objective
Develop a system that automatically summarizes long articles, blogs, or news reports into short, coherent summaries.

 Dataset
Source: CNN/Daily Mail Dataset

Type: News articles paired with human-written summaries.

 Steps
Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize the textual data.

Extractive Summarization: Use spaCy to extract key sentences.

Abstractive Summarization: Apply pre-trained models like BERT or GPT using HuggingFace Transformers.

Fine-Tuning: Improve model performance on the target dataset.

Evaluation: Test on real-world articles and assess summary quality.

 Outcome
Dual approach (extractive + abstractive) summarization system.

High-quality, human-like summaries from lengthy texts.

Ready-to-use model for summarizing articles, blogs, or news.
